        title: "2. Overview of Our Privacy Approach",
        body: 'OptigoAI is designed with a privacy-first approach. Unlike many AI services that collect and retain user data, OptigoAI is built to minimize data collection and maximize user privacy. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP address that can be linked to you. We do not train our models based on your data. No personal data is stored on our servers or retained by OptigoAI beyond what is strictly necessary to process your current request.',

        title: "3. Information We Do Not Collect",
        body: 'OptigoAI does not collect or store the following personally identifiable information: your IP address, name, email address, phone number, physical address, date of birth, government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, or any other data that can be directly linked to your identity. We do not maintain user profiles or accounts that tie your activity to a persistent identity. Your interactions with OptigoAI are ephemeral and are not associated with a personal identifier.',

        body: 'When you use OptigoAI, the following data may be temporarily processed to generate responses: (a) Your search queries and text input submitted to the assistant. (b) Content from the webpage you are currently viewing, if you ask a question about it. (c) Text you highlight on a page. (d) Images you upload for visual search or editing. (e) Derived queries sent to search services to improve answer quality. This data is processed in real-time, used solely to generate your response, and is not permanently stored on our servers.

        body: 'We employ industry-standard security measures to protect any data that is temporarily processed: (a) All data in transit is encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols. (b) Data processing occurs in isolated, encrypted memory environments. (c) Access to processing infrastructure is restricted to authorized personnel only. (d) We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments. (e) We do not store personal data on our servers, eliminating the risk of data breaches involving personal information. Despite these measures, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we encourage you to practice good security habits.',
